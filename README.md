# Awesome CSS Grid

> understanding the basic concepts of CSS Grid
 
 ## Grid fundamentals
- CSS Grid is a fundamentally new approach to build layouts using CSS. 
- CSS Grid is not a competitor to Flexbox. 
- It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is a single dimension (rows OR columns).
- Introduces a series of properties that allow us to create grid structures and control the placement and sizing of grid items using CSS:
    * for creating grid
